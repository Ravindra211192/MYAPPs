To delete repo branch locally:
	-->git branch -d localbranchname
To delete repo branch remotely:
	-->git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

Try to synchronize the branch list using:
	-->git fetch -p
    The -p flag means "prune". After fetching, branches which no longer exist on the remote will be deleted.
